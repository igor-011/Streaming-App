# Streaming-App
A Project that uses two apis. the TMDB API. and the Youtube Database API.
the tmdb api  searches for the shows on the tmdb and then the information is implemented in six rows. each being of a different topic.
after that the youtube database is used when the user clicks on a show's trailer button. when that happens. an api call will be made the the youtube database and searche the trailer. after that a new browser tab will be opened with the show's trailer on youtube.
